<c.yellow>Did you talk to her ?</c>
..playing opera.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>What did you talk about ?</c>

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:07.960 align:middle line:-2
About the moor, mostly.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:14.160 align:middle line:-3
It was her first time. I don't talk
to anyone usually. I avoid people.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.960 align:middle line:-2
Said she was a landscape painter.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:43.960 align:middle line:-3
Said she was old-fashioned. Showed
me some photos of her paintings.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.640 align:middle line:-3
Glowed with colours
most people don't see.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:53.960 align:middle line:-3

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:53.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Staying local, was she ?</c>

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.960 align:middle line:-2

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:57.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>You weren't interested.</c>

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.960 align:middle line:-2
What's that supposed to mean ?

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:06.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Might've invited her for a drink.</c>

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:06.960 align:middle line:-2
I'm married.
<c.yellow>Married men do ask pretty girls out.</c>

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:13.800 align:middle line:-3
I was born here. Everyone knows me.
Where'd I take her ?

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:13.800 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>You're up early this morning.</c>

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.960 align:middle line:-2

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:21.960 align:middle line:-3

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:27.960 align:middle line:-2

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:35.960 align:middle line:-2

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:35.960 align:middle line:-3

You act as if you think I did it.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:52.480 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>Wouldn't be the first murderer</c>
<c.yellow>to lead the police to a body.</c>

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:57.640 align:middle line:-3
I couldn't kill on the moor.
This place is life. My life.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.960 align:middle line:-2
There's death here...

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:03.960 align:middle line:-3
..but it's natural.
Life through death. Natural.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.960 align:middle line:-2

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>I'll leave the door open.</c>

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:53.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Company ?</c>

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:53.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>What ?</c>
<c.cyan>You getting a kitten.</c>

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.480 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>For company ?</c>

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>In a way, I suppose.</c>

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.160 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>I'm married.</c>

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Happily ?</c>

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Very.</c>

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Stephen Whalby was in last night ?</c>

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>He was in.</c>

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:41.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>What time ?</c>

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:41.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>Early.</c>
<c.yellow><i> What do you call early ?</i></c>

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>Stayed on a bit.</c>

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:44.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Seven ? Eight ?</c>

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.000 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>Maybe. </c>

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.160 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>What ?</c>

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>We had a coach party in.</c>

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>There were a lot of people here.</c>

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>What time did he say he was in ?</c>

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:57.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Are you being funny ?</c>

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:04.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>You're not from round here, are you?</c>

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:04.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>What's that got to do with it ?</c>
<c.color008000>Bloody rude.</c>

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:09.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.color008000>We don't like rudeness.</c>
<c.color008000>Keep it for where you come from.</c>

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:09.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Look here -</c>

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:16.480 align:middle line:-3
<c.color008000>Stephen Whalby and his family</c>
<c.color008000>are much respected around here.</c>

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.color008000>He knows the moor</c>
<c.color008000>better than any man.</c>

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:24.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.color008000>He's the gentlest man I know.</c>
<c.color008000>He wouldn't tread on an ant...</c>

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:31.320 align:middle line:-3
<c.color008000>..and you're trying to tie him in</c>
<c.color008000>with this dreadful business.</c>

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:31.320 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>I'm conducting a murder inquiry.</c>

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:37.480 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>My questions'd best be answered</c>
<c.yellow>tomorrow morning at the station.</c>

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Be there.</c>

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:56.800 align:middle line:-3
Bees are appearing in large numbers,
do to the mildness of the winter.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:02.960 align:middle line:-3
But few will escape the predatory
beaks of our Vangmoor songsters.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:18.000 align:middle line:-3
Let's hope we'll see an increase
in the butterfly population,...

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.640 align:middle line:-3
..like the rare Lycaenidae,
known as the Foinland Blue.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:33.960 align:middle line:-3
Next week I'll be writing
about moorland walks...

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:40.960 align:middle line:-3
..and suggesting an itinerary taking
in the ever attractive Tower Foin.

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>Stephen ?</c>

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>You can come in.</c>

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000><i> Ste...</i></c>

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>Excuse me.</c>

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.480 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>Mr Whalby ?</c>

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.640 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Yes ?</c>

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>I'm from the Three Towns Echo.</c>

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Oh, you'll want Stephen. My son.</c>

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>I don't know. They didn't say.</c>

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>I'll get him for you.</c>

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Stephen ! </c>

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:17.640 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Some woman.</c>
<c.cyan>Says she's from the paper. </c>

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.960 align:middle line:-2
Which paper ?

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:35.160 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>The Echo.</c>

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:35.160 align:middle line:-2
I don't know you.

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:40.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>You write the Voice of Vangmoor.</c>

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:40.960 align:middle line:-2
Are you new ?
<c.color008000>Two months, from London.</c>

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000><i> Used to be with The Independent.</i></c>

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:53.640 align:middle line:-3
<c.color008000>They want me to interview you</c>
<c.color008000>about the girl.</c>

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.960 align:middle line:-2
I'm going to write it myself.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.800 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>Have you talked to them about it ?</c>

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.960 align:middle line:-2
Not yet. No... but I...

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>They sent me.</c>

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>They didn't say.</c>

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:17.000 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>This is rather embarrassing.</c>

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:17.000 align:middle line:-2
I'm sorry. I thought they'd have...

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:20.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>I'll phone.</c>

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:20.960 align:middle line:-2
Please.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>John ?</c>

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:31.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>How long is this going to take ?</c>

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:38.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>You're late on that chaise longue.</c>
<c.cyan>That was promised for last Thursday.</c>

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:48.000 align:middle line:-3
I've never written this kind of
thing before. They may think I can't.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Write it for somebody else.</c>

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:53.960 align:middle line:-3
No, I can't do that.
<c.cyan>Why not ?</c>
Because it isn't...

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.960 align:middle line:-2
They want you to do it.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:01.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>I'm sorry.</c>

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:08.960 align:middle line:-3
Why don't we go out on the moor ?
It's stopped raining.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.960 align:middle line:-2
Get the feel of the place.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.960 align:middle line:-2
<i> Atmosphere.</i>

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.000 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>Yeah. Good idea.</c>

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:25.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>Why not ?</c>

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:25.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>Now, don't be all bloody day.</c>
<c.cyan>We've got a business to run, son.</c>

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:35.960 align:middle line:-2
RADIO: 'There'll be persistent rain'

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.960 align:middle line:-2
'Tomorrow will be wet and windy.'

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:36.960 align:middle line:-3
When I was a boy, I used to imagine
that the moor belonged to me.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.960 align:middle line:-2
That I was the master of the moor.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:45.960 align:middle line:-3
After my mother left. Freud would
say I was compensating for a loss.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.color008000>I wish it hadn't had to be you</c>
<c.color008000>who found the body.</c>

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:52.960 align:middle line:-2
So do I.

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.red> </c>SHOP BELL

<c.yellow>Yes.</c>

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>What for ?</c>

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:09.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Er... more cat food.</c>

<c.cyan><i> You can't have.</i></c>

<c.yellow>No. No, it's just...</c>
<c.yellow>I was passing and I...</c>

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:20.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>I won't be shopping again until -</c>

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:20.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>How many tins ?</c>

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.800 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>What ?</c>

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:24.800 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Of cat food.</c>

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>I'm 25.</c>

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:09.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>I was married in church.</c>

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:16.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>I've lived with my husband</c>
<c.yellow>four years.</c>

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>So, I must be married.</c>

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>I have no children.</c>

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.000 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>And never shall have.</c>

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.160 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>But I'm waiting.</c>

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.000 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Waiting.</c>

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>For what, eh ? I don't quite know.</c>

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:51.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>I really must go now.</c>

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>What is it ?</c>

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:23.960 align:middle line:-2
She had silver buckles on her boots.

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:29.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.color008000>Were you very shocked</c>
<c.color008000>when you found her ?</c>

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:34.960 align:middle line:-3
It was her eyes. They weren't eyes,
they were like stones.

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>I've never seen a dead body before.</c>

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.960 align:middle line:-2
Nor had I.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>How did it feel ?</c>

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>I'm sorry. You must think I'm awful.</c>

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.000 align:middle line:-2
I didn't feel anything.

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.960 align:middle line:-2
It was like being part of a dream.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.160 align:middle line:-2
No, not a dream.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:06.960 align:middle line:-3
Like being between sleeping
and waking when you're not sure...

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.960 align:middle line:-2
..if what you see is there.

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:11.160 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>When did you know it was real ?</c>

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:14.480 align:middle line:-2
Real ?

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:14.480 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>Yeah.</c>

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:23.960 align:middle line:-3
I read once that nothing's real till
it passes through the imagination.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:23.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>What do you mean ?</c>

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>What are you trying to say ? </c>

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:33.960 align:middle line:-3
You know, reality's a funny thing.
It plays games.. deceives, corrupts.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:41.960 align:middle line:-2
I'm sorry. This is bloody nonsense.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:41.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>No, it's not. Go on.</c>

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.960 align:middle line:-2
I had a premonition when I was a boy

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:53.960 align:middle line:-3
'I knew that one day
I'd find a body on the moor.'

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:56.960 align:middle line:-3
'And there'd be a second
and a third.'

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.160 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>Who is he ?</c>

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.960 align:middle line:-2
I don't know.

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>What's the matter ?</c>

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>Stephen ?</c>

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>Stephen, you do know him.</c>

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.960 align:middle line:-2
No.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>He's waiting for you. </c>

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.960 align:middle line:-2
Maybe he's waiting for you.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>What do you mean ?</c>

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:45.960 align:middle line:-2
He's gone.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.800 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>I think we should tell the police.</c>

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:50.800 align:middle line:-2
Tell them what ?

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>There was a strange man on the moor.</c>

00:31:55.960 --> 00:32:01.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.color008000>There was something about him.</c>
<c.color008000>Something you're not telling me.</c>

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.320 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>I've got something for you.</c>

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:25.480 align:middle line:-3
<c.cyan>You mustn't go ruining it</c>
<c.cyan>with cups of hot tea.</c>

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:31.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>Oh, it's beautiful.</c>

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:35.960 align:middle line:-3

<c.cyan>His own paper.</c>

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:12.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>I thought he was going to write it.</c>

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:17.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.color008000>He's too soft.</c>
<c.color008000>He should have told them, insisted. </c>

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:23.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>He's got to watch what he says.</c>

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:23.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Why ?</c>
<c.color008000>Didn't he tell you ?</c>

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:27.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.cyan>Tell me what ?</c>

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:06.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>We kissed, briefly.</c>

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>He tried.</c>

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>He did try.</c>

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.color008000>He... he isn't impotent.</c>

<c.yellow>Mr Whalby (!)</c>

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.320 align:middle line:-2
Saw the car last night. Twice.

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.960 align:middle line:-2
I wondered...

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>What ?</c>

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Wondered what, Mr Whalby ?</c>

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:29.960 align:middle line:-2
Well, who...

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:35.160 align:middle line:-2
There hasn't been another...?

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:35.160 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Another what ?</c>

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.960 align:middle line:-2
More trouble.

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:41.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>What do you mean, 'trouble' ?</c>

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:45.480 align:middle line:-2
We saw a strange man on the moor.

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:49.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>We ?</c>

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:49.960 align:middle line:-2
I was with a reporter from the Echo.

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:53.640 align:middle line:-3
She wanted an interview
about the first...

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:55.800 align:middle line:-2
So I took her to the...

00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:01.960 align:middle line:-3
..and we were coming back
and we saw a man in the distance.

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:04.960 align:middle line:-2
She said we should report it.

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:06.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>Why didn't you ?</c>

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:09.960 align:middle line:-2
I went back late evening and...

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.000 align:middle line:-2
..to see, well to try...

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:19.960 align:middle line:-2
Then I saw the car the first time.

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:19.960 align:middle line:-3
<c.yellow>You went to look for the man ?</c>
Yes.
<c.yellow>Did you find him ?</c>

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:24.960 align:middle line:-3
No. And then I saw the car again.
And I thought...

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:29.960 align:middle line:-2
..I thought I'd just...

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:34.960 align:middle line:-3
I just thought
I'd check it out again this morning.

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:37.960 align:middle line:-2

<c.yellow>Her husband rang us.</c>
<c.yellow>We're looking for her.</c>

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:48.320 align:middle line:-2
She was a botanist.

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:52.960 align:middle line:-2
<c.yellow>How did you know ?</c>

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:57.960 align:middle line:-3
The book in the car is a botanist's
bible for moorland plants.

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:01.000 align:middle line:-2
Probably looking for orchids.

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:04.960 align:middle line:-2

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:26.960 align:middle line:-2

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:33.320 align:middle line:-3
